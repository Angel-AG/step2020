            My name is Angel Guevara.
            I am a Computer Science student at Tecnológico de Monterrey (ITESM).
            I describe myself as someone looking always to learn and acquire
            new knowledge and skills, and keeping improving through continuous work
            and by learning from my peers.

            I was first introduced to Computer Science when my father bought me
            an Arduino, I remember the exact date, because it was my birthday.
            It was a very cool present, I liked the electronics and programming
            stuff. The projects were interesting and fun to do, and well, my first
            project was the equivalent to a “Hello, World!” program, but in 
            the electronics world, a blinking LED. I only had it that spring and
            summer, because I moved to another city to study high school and I 
            couldn’t bring it with me. 
          </p>

            My interest for computer science started to grow during high school.
            I had a basic course of computational thinking and did a school project
            using Arduino, in which in a team of 4 we built and programed a robot
            to avoid obstacles in its way. It was in my last year of high school
            when I decided to focus on software rather than on robotics/electronics,
            all thanks to a competition called MIT-ZeroRobotics, in which my team
            and I had to write a program for a SPHERE satellite in order to 
            accomplish a specific task by controlling the satellite's speed, 
            rotation, direction and more through our code written in C.

          <p>I have also two dogs, Fifi, a chihuaha, and Laika, a beagle.</p>
