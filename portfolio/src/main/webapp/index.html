        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Angel Guevara.
          I am a Computer Science student at Tecnológico de Monterrey (ITESM).
          I describe myself as someone looking always to learn and acquire
          new knowledge and skills, and keeping improving through continuous work
          and by learning from my peers.
        </p>

          I was first introduced to Computer Science when my father bought me
          an Arduino, I remember the exact date, because it was my birthday.
          It was a very cool present, I liked the electronics and programming
          stuff. The projects were interesting and fun to do, and well, my first
          project was the equivalent to a “Hello, World!” program, but in 
          the electronics world, a blinking LED. I only had it that spring and
          summer, because I moved to another city to study high school and I 
          couldn’t bring it with me. 
        </p>

          My interest for computer science started to grow during high school.
          I had a basic course of computational thinking and did a school project
          using Arduino, in which in a team of 4 we built and programed a robot
          to avoid obstacles in its way. It was in my last year of high school
          when I decided to focus on software rather than on robotics/electronics,
          all thanks to a competition called MIT-ZeroRobotics, in which my team
          and I had to write a program for a SPHERE satellite in order to 
          accomplish a specific task by controlling the satellite's speed, 
          rotation, direction and more through our code written in C.
